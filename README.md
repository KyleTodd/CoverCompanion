# CoverCompanion

CoverCompanion is a web application designed to streamline and enhance the experience of managing and interacting with a client's insurance policies. We found that many clients would just keep the policy in an email and was very hard to find when required without the brokers assistance. Hence an online system collecting all of their policies in one place was sought after but we could not find one on the market that fit our needs.
